# Required Software

These lesson requires the installation of R, RStudio, and BASH. The R open-source software is an object-oriented programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows, 
and MacOS. 

RStudio is a set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R. It includes a console, syntax-
highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and a variety of robust tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging, and managing your workspace.

The command line terminal available to Mac OS and Linux is a powerful tool and where the magic happens. It’s excellent for software development, file management, remote analysis, and a myriad of other tasks.

- For Windows 10 systems updated to the Windows 10 Fall Creators update released October 2017, run the following in PowerShell as Administrator: 
> ~~~
> dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
- For Windows 10 systems updated to the Windows 10 May 2020 update and newer run the following in PowerShell as Administrator: 
> ~~~
> dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
- Then restart your computer.
- Now Ubuntu can be installed from the Microsoft Store:
- Use the Start menu to launch the Microsoft Store application.
- Search for Ubuntu and select the first result, "Ubuntu", published by Canonical Group Limited.
- Click on the Install button. Ubuntu will be downloaded and installed automatically. Progress will be reported within the Microsoft Store application.
- Ubuntu can now be launched in the same way as any other Windows 10 application, such as searching for and selecting Ubuntu in the Start menu.
- When launched for the first time, Ubuntu will inform you that it’s "Installing" and you’ll need to wait a few moments.
