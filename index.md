## Description
This is the second lesson in a two-part workshop series [Programming and Data Analysis with R and BASH](https://elizabethbrooks.github.io/NFCDSWorkshop_BeginnersGuide_BioinformaticsDataAnalysis/), which is delivered as part of the NFCDS pedagogdy fellowship program. 

Given the increasing amount of data being generated today, programmatic data analysis is an important skill for a wide range of fields. The R programming language and Unix/Linux command line can be powerful tools for analyzing data. Even more powerfully, the huge variety of R and command line tools can be used together with scripting to create custom pipelines to analyze large or complex data sets.

## Outcomes
In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn about biological data analysis with R and Unix/Linux tools, with a focus on techniques for creating modular R and BASH scripts. Additionally, participants will explore how to create custom scripts to automate the analysis of large data sets. This workshop includes an introduction to scripting and biological data analysis, with a focus on comparative techniques for creating modular R and BASH scripts.

## Audience
This lesson is designed for anyone interested in learning how to combine R and BASH scripting to automate the analysis of biological data sets. For example, biologists interested in learning how to create pipelines that use a combination of R scripts to analyze and visualize data. Another potential application of the skills learned from this workshop is the ability to create a set of scripts that work together to integrate specific omics tools in a data analysis workflow. This is an extension of the [A Beginner's Guide to Programming and Data Analysis with R and BASH](https://elizabethbrooks.github.io/NFCDSWorkshop_BioinformaticsDataAnalysis/) workshop, and knowledge of basic programming and data analysis techniques is expected.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> 1. Participants should be comfortable with using a computer and basic statistical methods. Furthermore, participants should have:
> - used a computer before
> - limited to no experience with BASH
> - limited to no experience with R
>
> 2. Each participant needs to have access to a computer with Unix/Linux or the Windows Ubuntu app. If you are attending the workshop in person, then a computer will be available for you. 
>
> 3. Since this is an introductory workshop, we will walkthrough installing the necessary software. 
> 4. Please complete the [pre-workshop survey][preSurvey] before getting started with the workshop.
